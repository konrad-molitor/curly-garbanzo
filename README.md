# 2048

A responsive 2048 clone built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Local development

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory using any static file server (for example `python -m http.server`).

## Deployment

Push to the `main` branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, which publishes the site to GitHub Pages.
